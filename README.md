# Welcome to my profile!

 I'm Carl  
 a college student currently studying computer science  
 ---although it's not my major at school. ╯︿╰  
 But it doesn't matter, I still have the internet and the LLMs👍  
 
 And，I don't have any repositories worth learning from,  
 so I guess you want to play social engineering?
